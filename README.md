# Workbook 5 â€“ Java Practice Projects

This folder contains my Java exercises from Workbook 5.

## ðŸ“˜ Exercises Included

### âœ… Vehicles
- Builds a class hierarchy using inheritance to represent different vehicle types
- Defines and uses the following classes:
  - `Vehicle` â€“ parent class containing shared properties like color, fuel capacity, and passenger info
  - `Moped`, `Car`, `SemiTruck`, `Hovercraft` â€“ child classes that extend `Vehicle`
- Set up all vehicle types without constructors (to be added in the next exercise)
- Used setters to assign values to each vehicle object and printed outputs to test them
- Great practice for:
  - Designing inheritance hierarchies
  - Using setters/getters to manage encapsulated fields
  - Understanding how subclass objects inherit behavior from a parent class
  - Practicing object creation and testing in `main()`

## âœ¨ What I Learned
- How to design reusable class structures using inheritance  
- How to store shared properties in a superclass and extend them in child classes  
- How subclasses can use methods from their parent even if the parent wasnâ€™t directly instantiated  
- How to build and test multiple object types with shared behavior
